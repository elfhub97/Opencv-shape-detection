# Opencv-shape-detrction
Finding shapes in an image using opencv- python
We can find shapes present in an image using the findContours () and approxPolyDP () function of OpenCV. We can detect shapes depending on the number of corners it has. For example, a triangle has 3 corners, a square has 4 corners, and a pentagon has 5 corners.
